    <span class="hello">
      <em>Why</em>
      <small>Keep Writing Blog?
    </span>
  </h1>

  <h2>1. Personal Need</h2> 
  <p>
    By writing blog, I could able to document my life experience. For so many time, I failed to recall expriences and what I have learned clearly.
  </p>

  <p>
    Memories are so fragile! Keeping a note is a good way to keep my life lively.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Systematically Learn Kownledge</h2> 
  <p>
    Writing blog, especially technic blog is a good way to review theose knowledge systematically. When begin writing blog, I tried to build up the connection among the knowledge I have learned.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Sharing is Happy</h2> 
  <p>
    Sharing knowledge is a really a happy thing to me. My ultimate goal is to achieve something really pracitical for this world. Also, I like sharing and challenging difficulties. That's why I aims to become a professor in college. Start to write a blog is one of the great way to prepare for my goal.
  </p>
  

  <h2>4. Knowledge Interaction</h2> 
  <p>
    Writing blog is also an another way to listen to people, for not only technic correction, but also life. As for technic blog, for sure I could not ensure all the things I write is 100% right. I will try my best to leave as least wrong idea as possible, but blog is a good way for reader to help me correct it. As for life experience, I would like to hear from different opinions. And I will try to best to do the best.
